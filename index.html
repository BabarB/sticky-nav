<h1>Sticky menu project</h1>
<!--calling myFunction:-->
<body onscroll = "MyFunction()">
    <div class="header">
        <h2>Scroll down!</h2>
        <p>Scroll down to see the sticky effect</p>
    </div>
    <div class="navbar">
        <!--void prevents it from leaving page-->
        <a href="javascript:void(0)">Home</a>
        <a href="javascript:void(0)">About</a>

    </div>
    <div class = "content">
        <p>The navbar will stick to the top when you reach its scroll position.
            The scroll position is the read-only Window property 
             scrollY; it returns the number of pixels the document is 
             currently scrolled along the vertical axis 
             (that is, up or down) with a value of 0.0, 
             indicating that the top edge of the Document 
             is currently aligned with the top edge of the 
             window's content area.
            This property's value will then be compared with that of the offsetTop property,
            which returns the top position (in pixels) relative to the parent. 
            The returned value includes: the top position, 
            and margin of the element. the top padding, 
            scrollbar and border of the parent.
            If no offset parent exists, the offset is
            relative to the document body. 
            This is the case here! This is why we can compare them.
            I did not understand why the content margin top needs to go down by
            60 pixels. And is is just the margin top that goes down or also the new 
            css class tom, who is responsible for the stickyness of the nav bar, by having a 
            0 top in css?
            To recreate this, i removed code ..... and added the elements separately if/else statement in 
            the JS. This enabled me to test how tom reacts vs how the content class reacts 
            when given a margintop style.
