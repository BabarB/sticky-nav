<h1>Sticky menu project</h1>

    <div class="header">
        <h2>Scroll down!</h2>
        <p>Scroll down to see the sticky effect</p>
    </div>
    <div class="navbar">
        <!--void prevents it from leaving page-->
        <a href="javascript:void(0)">Home</a>

    <div class = "content">
        <p>The navbar will stick to the top when you reach its scroll position.
            The scroll position is the read-only Window property 
             scrollY; it returns the number of pixels the document is 
             currently scrolled along the vertical axis 
             (that is, up or down) with a value of 0.0, 
             indicating that the top edge of the Document 
             is currently aligned with the top edge of the 
             window's content area.
            This property's value will then be compared with The offsetTop property,
            which returns the top position (in pixels) relative to the parent. 
            The returned value includes: the top position, 
            and margin of the element. the top padding, 
            scrollbar and border of the parent.
            If no offset parent exists, the offset is
            relative to the document body. 
            This is the case here. </p>
